# Word2Vec in Keras

A Keras implementation of [word2vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781), specifically the continuous Skip-gram model for computing continuous vector representations of words from very large data sets. The quality of the word vectors is measured in a word similarity task, with word2vec showing a large improvement in accuracy at a much lower computational cost. Further, word2vec performs at state-of-the-art accuracy for measuring  syntactic and semantic word similarities.
